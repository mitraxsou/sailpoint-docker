Procedurally generated HR Data
==============================

By default, a demonstration set of HR data is imported into the MySQL database to `hr.hr_people`. SELECT access to this table is granted to the `identityiq` user.

All data is procedurally generated by a program developed at IDW. No record is intended to resemble any real-life individuals.

# Description of the data

This data represents an imaginary medium-sized grocery store corporation.

Requirements used by the generator follow:

* There are around 5,600 full and part time employees.
* There are two affiliate companies (Primary Grocers Inc and Affiliate Grocers Inc) which have separate manager hierarchies and locations. 
* A few people may have a record at more than one company. For example, Jim worked as a cashier at Affiliate then quit, then later took a job at Primary. 
* Users will have no more than one record per company.
* The manager hierarchy is a consistent tree with multiple layers of managers depending on department size. Managers are mapped by employee number.
* The full assortment of employment situations is represented: pre-hire, current employee, terminated, rehired.
* A small subset of users are current employees on leave (status `L`).

The `employee_number` field is intended as the unique ID.

# Fake SSNs

The dataset includes an `ssn` field with SSN-formatted randomly generated values. These values begin with 9xx so are not valid SSNs. This field is intended for demonstrating or practicing PII management.

# Additional datasets

Additional larger or smaller randomly generated user sets are available on request. 

We also have generated university datasets with users having multiple valid affiliations, class and degree history, etc.
